# Health-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
This capstone project applies machine learning techniques to predict annual medical insurance claim costs. Using a synthetic dataset, we explore linear regression, random forest, and gradient boosting models to identify key cost drivers such as smoking status, BMI, and blood pressure.

📁 # **Dataset Description**

The dataset used in this project contains synthetic health insurance claim data for individual patients. Each record represents a single insured person along with various demographic, health, and lifestyle variables, and their corresponding annual medical claim amount.
